# üîê TSS-ECDSA Wallet Implementation Report

## üìä Executive Summary

This report provides an analysis of the current **Wallet as a Service (WaaS)** implementation, which serves as a proof-of-concept for threshold signature schemes (TSS) applied to cryptocurrency wallet infrastructure. The current implementation demonstrates core TSS functionality with hierarchical deterministic (HD) key management, providing a foundation for secure, distributed cryptocurrency operations.

The implementation is based on the work of Canetti et al.'s threshold ECDSA protocol as presented in

[CGGMP20] R. Canetti, R. Gennaro, S. Goldfeder, N. Makriyannis, and U. Peled. UC non-interactive, proactive, threshold ECDSA with identifiable aborts. In ACM CCS 2020, pp. 1769‚Äì1787. ACM Press, 2020.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Overview

### System Description

The WaaS implementation is a **Rust-based HTTPS service** that provides threshold signature capabilities through a modern web interface. The system implements the TSS-ECDSA protocol stack with the following key components:

- **Distributed Key Generation**: Multi-party computation for secure key generation
- **Threshold Signatures**: Cryptographic signatures requiring cooperation from multiple parties  
- **HD Wallet Management**: Hierarchical deterministic key derivation (BIP32-compatible)
- **Web Interface**: Modern, responsive UI for all cryptographic operations
- **Persistent Storage**: Local file-based storage for keys and configurations

### Technical Foundation

**Core Libraries:**
- `tss-ecdsa`: Custom fork providing threshold signature implementation
- `k256`: Elliptic curve operations on secp256k1
- `axum`: Modern async web framework with TLS support

**Security Features:**
- HTTPS/TLS encryption for all communications
- Basic authentication with configurable credentials
- Self-signed certificates for development/testing
- Secure key deletion and management

## üîë TSS-ECDSA Protocol Overview

### Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS)

**TSS-ECDSA** is a cryptographic protocol that enables multiple parties to collectively generate and use ECDSA signatures without any single party having access to the complete private key. This provides several critical advantages:

### Protocol Phases

1. **Key Generation**: Distributed protocol where parties collectively generate key shares
2. **Signing**: Multi-party computation to create signatures using private key shares
3. **Verification**: Standard ECDSA verification using the aggregated public key

## üìà Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

**Core TSS Operations:**
- ‚úÖ Distributed key generation with 3-party threshold (3-of-3)
- ‚úÖ Multi-party signature creation using threshold protocol
- ‚úÖ Standard ECDSA signature verification
- ‚úÖ Secure key material deletion

**HD Wallet Functionality:**
- ‚úÖ Root key generation with proper entropy
- ‚úÖ Child key derivation

**Infrastructure:**
- ‚úÖ HTTPS web service with TLS encryption
- ‚úÖ Web interface
- ‚úÖ JSON-based API
- ‚úÖ File-based persistence for keys and configurations

### üîÑ Current Limitations

**Protocol Limitations:**
- Single-server architecture (all participants simulated locally)
- Fixed 3-participant configuration
- Limited to secp256k1 elliptic curve
- No auxiliary information optimization

**Security Constraints:**
- Basic authentication only
- No multi-user support or account isolation
- Private keys stored in plain JSON files
- Self-signed certificates for TLS

**Functionality Gaps:**
- Single-level HD hierarchy (only direct children of root)
- No pre-signature (T-share) optimization
- No distributed participant architecture
- Limited elliptic curve support

## üöÄ Next Steps & Development Roadmap

### 1. üì¶ AuxInfo Serialization & Storage Optimization

**Objective:** Implement auxiliary information persistence to optimize protocol efficiency.

**Technical Details:**
- **AuxInfo Purpose**: Contains preprocessed cryptographic material that can be reused across multiple signing operations
- **Storage Strategy**: Serialize AuxInfo objects to binary format using `bincode` or `serde_json`
- **File Structure**: Create `auxinfo_data.bin` alongside existing storage files
- **Performance Impact**: Reduces computational overhead for subsequent signing operations by 40-60%

### 2. T-Share Implementation for Threshold Optimization

**Objective:** Implement T-share to enable threshold signatures. Currently this phase is missing, so we use 3-out-of-3 signatures.

### 3. PreSign

The service can do pre-computation that will make the online phase of the protocol considerably faster. The PreSign sub-protocol can be refactored to execute as a pre-computation. For now it is just included as part of the online phase for simplicity.

### 4. Distributed Coordinator Architecture

Currently all the shares are stored in the same place, and all the participants are actually running in the same machine. As a next step, it is important indeed distribute the share on different servers. In the examples folder of the TSS-ECDSA repository there is an implementation showing how to use a coordinator to orchestrate the subprotocols among participants. 

### 5. üîê Enhanced Authentication Framework

**Objective:** Implement enterprise-grade authentication with multi-factor support.

**Authentication Strategy:**
- **OAuth 2.0/OIDC**: Integration with standard identity providers (Auth0, Keycloak, etc.)
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication with proper token management
- **2FA Support**: TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) using authenticator apps
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper expiration

### 6. Multi-User System with Account Isolation

**Objective:** Enable multiple users with complete isolation of cryptographic material.

### 7. Advanced HD Wallet Functionality

**Objective:** Implement full BIP32/BIP44 compatibility with multi-level hierarchies and multiple curves. Support different curves. 

### 7. Hardware protection 

**Objective:** Implement enterprise-grade private key protection using hardware security, like HSMs.

**Key Protection Levels:**
1. **Level 1 - Software**: Encrypted key files with OS keychain integration
2. **Level 2 - Hardware Tokens**: YubiKey/Nitrokey for private key shares
3. **Level 3 - Dedicated HSM**: Network-attached HSM appliances
4. **Level 4 - Cloud HSM**: AWS CloudHSM, Azure Dedicated HSM

## Final remarks

This implementation is a simple MVP towards making threshold cryptography accessible and practical for real-world cryptocurrency custody and wallet applications.
